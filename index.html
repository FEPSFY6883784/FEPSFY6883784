              Early diagnosis of cancer is crucial for improving survival rates. Even though 80% of cancers are diagnosed at a late stage, recent advances in screening programmes and public health initiatives help improve the discover of cancer. 
              One promising approach to early diagnosis is the use of blood-based liquid biopsies. However, assessing the effectiveness of early diagnosis requires a combination of process and outcome measures. This article aims to discuss the 
              progress made in early cancer detection, monitoring the progress of early intervention, and improvement in early detection strategies.

<pre>
  The importance of early diagnosis is critical for identifying cancer, which can significantly improve survival rates.80% of cancers are diagnosed at a late stage, a statistic that raises concern and highlights a need for improvement. Through 
  the significance of screening programmes (identifying the cancer and at what stage) along with initiatives like the “Be clear on cancer campaign” (providing awareness of the screening programmes) both coinciding to improve the discovery of cancer. 
  Additionally, process and outcome measures are needed to evaluate whether sufficient progress has been made in assessing the effectiveness of early intervention.

<h3 id="Analysis and discussion">The impact early diagnosis has had</h3>

Early detection of cancer prevents metastasis from happening at a quicker rate (Pashayan, N. & Pharoah, 2020). Early interventions are primarily aimed at populations at higher risk of developing cancer, often based on age or the presence of symptoms. 
These individuals are referred to hospitals, which identifies the presence of cancer and determines its stage. Cancer is classified into four main stages, indicating its location and whether it has spread to surrounding tissue. The higher the stage, 
the further the cancer has spread.
