              Early diagnosis of cancer is crucial for improving survival rates. Even though 80% of cancers are diagnosed at a late stage, recent advances in screening programmes and public health initiatives help improve the discover of cancer. 
              One promising approach to early diagnosis is the use of blood-based liquid biopsies. However, assessing the effectiveness of early diagnosis requires a combination of process and outcome measures. This article aims to discuss the 
              progress made in early cancer detection, monitoring the progress of early intervention, and improvement in early detection strategies.

  The importance of early diagnosis is critical for identifying cancer, which can significantly improve survival rates.80% of cancers are diagnosed at a late stage, a statistic that raises concern and highlights a need for improvement. Through 
  the significance of screening programmes (identifying the cancer and at what stage) along with initiatives like the “Be clear on cancer campaign” (providing awareness of the screening programmes) both coinciding to improve the discovery of cancer. 
  Additionally, process and outcome measures are needed to evaluate whether sufficient progress has been made in assessing the effectiveness of early intervention.

   <h3 id=”Analysis and discussion”>The impact early diagnosis has had</h3>

Early detection of cancer prevents metastasis from happening at a quicker rate <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32381710/">(Pashayan, N. & Pharoah,2020)</a>. Early interventions are primarily aimed at populations at higher risk of developing cancer, often based on age or the presence of symptoms. 
These individuals are referred to hospitals, which identifies the presence of cancer and determines its stage. Cancer is classified into four main stages, indicating its location and whether it has spread to surrounding tissue. The higher the stage, 
the further the cancer has spread.              

This is about an interesting study about the use of blood-based liquid biopsies to detect ovarian cancer for an early diagnosis. There are 5 different strategies being used like a different tool in a toolbox; identifying cancer-specific proteins, 
studying the DNA fragments, looking into the MicroRNas count in the blood, types of exosomes released, testing combination of markers, tying it all in using data analysis to identify any patterns. These methods are combined to detect ovarian cancer 
using just a blood test, by testing blood-based biomarkers to spot ovarian cancer sooner even before symptoms appear.

<h3 id="Analysis and discussion">Monitoring true progress</h3>

Despite there being numerous positives when it comes to early diagnosis, is there a significant amount of progress being made? This can be evaluated via process and outcome measures, which are intervention specific as one of the measures cannot be 
enough.

Process measures essentially indicate what is used to maintain or improve (in this case) cancer. This specifies if the intervention has improved the patient's conditions. This leads to an outcome measure as it reflects the impact of the process measure.
A scenario of calculating the measures is if a sample size of 200 women is eligible for breast screening. 60 out of the 200 women attend screening and 20 out of the 60 women are diagnosed with cancer. This signifies a process measure. Whereas for outcome 
measure a sample size of 200 people develop cancer 15 are at stage 3-4 and after a few months 5 people have passed from the cancer. As follows the scenario helps to understand the difference between the two measures however the main importance of the measure 
allows for an evaluation. Given that early diagnoses open a door to early treatment, is this achieving the goal of lowering cancer mortality, is it cost effective (limited NHS budget). 

By tracking outcome measures you can pinpoint whether screen is helping with mortality. Figures show that deaths lowered by 9% of women living in Ireland with screening compared to women of the same age group introduced to screening 8 years later (Mayor, 2017).
A weakness with this percentage is that it is only representative to Irish women. On the other hand, the researcher utilises this weakness by comparing the figure to other regions other than Ireland such as the Netherlands. As after 23 years of screening for breast 
cancer the mortality rate went from 0% to 5% (Pizot, 2017). This case study is seen as reliable as many years of evidence has been built for this figure to prove that the mortality rate has decreased.

Despite this case study being reliable the many years of evidence needed must have been very time consuming and very expensive to fund. Therefore, process measures are introduced to provide an earlier indication of how successful early diagnosis is. This proves how a 
combination of measures is needed to overcome any weaknesses of the study. As when used alone they are unable to measure the true progress researchers need.

<h3 id="Analysis and discussion">The difficulties of measuring true progress</h3>

Although researchers can assess the success of early diagnosis, there are two main issues which interrupt this success. Over diagnosis which would have never gone on to cause any harm to a person's lifetime regardless of having the disease. This can then go onto causing 
psychological stress and unnecessary treatments (which wastes a lot of money and could have avoided potential side effects). Lead time bias is a false impression when the survival rate of cancer appears to be longer as the cancer was detected at an earlier stage. However, 
their survival rate would have stayed the same regardless of what stage the cancer is detected at. These limitations to early diagnosis results in figures including the two different cases causing them to be unreliable. 

An outcome measure of over diagnosis and lead time bias affects the patient’s quality of life. As a recent study shows that cancer patients are not only dealing with treatment but rather psychological effects. Only 28% of patients processed to have a normal life and the 81% 
are left with stress and depression (Lewandowska, 2020). However, this study does not manage to say if these patients are affected by over diagnosis of lead time bias (as it is hard to detect by doctors).

<h3 id="Analysis aand discussion">Conclusion</h3>

Overall early diagnosis come with both positives and negatives in this case the positives weigh out the negatives. As detecting the cancer and having better treatment options available manages to reduce the risk of mortality. Significant progress is being made to a certain extent
as overdiagnosis and lead term bias prevents true figures of the mortality rates.
