          Early diagnosis of cancer is crucial for improving survival rates. Even though 80% of cancers are diagnosed at a late stage, recent advances in screening programmes and public health initiatives. One promising approach to early diagnosis is the use of blood-based liquid biopsies. However, assessing the effectiveness of early diagnosis requires a combination of process and outcome measures. This article aims to discuss the progress made in early cancer detection, monitoring the progress of early intervention, and improvement in early detection strategies              </pre>

                The importance of early diagnosis is critical for identifying cancer, which can significantly improve survival rates.80% of cancers are diagnosed at a late stage, a statistic that raises concern and highlights a need for improvement. Through the significance of screening programmes (identifying the cancer and at what stage) along with initiatives like the “Be clear on cancer campaign” (providing awareness of the screening programmes) both coinciding to improve the discovery of cancer. Additionally, process and outcome measures are needed to evaluate whether sufficient progress has been made in assessing the effectiveness of early intervention.              </pre>
